# File-Parser
This code is an application to filter and detect students who meet specific criteria. The criteria could be customized accordingly.
The code has been written in python.

What are these criteria?

Creating a cutting-edge application to filter files and identify students who meet specific criteria. We'll focus on full-time students who took over four years and part-time students who exceeded seven years to graduate. The resulting CSV file will feature these students, including a new "NumberOfYears" column, while preserving the original data structure. This innovation revolutionizes student data analysis, providing greater efficiency and insights. Of course, there are a plethora of ways this could be done.
